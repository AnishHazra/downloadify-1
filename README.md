Youtube video downloader website.

This project uses reactJS as frontend and flask as backend this time.

# Reason I pushed this simple project to Github

This time, I haven't used prebuilt libraries and packages in backend but made it from scratch. Backend uses just requests lib and web scraping method to scrape the video playback urls. Each and every line of backend is coded by me
